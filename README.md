Analysis into potential for opening a surfing/ice cream shop in Oahu using weather data and SQLite 

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze the viability of Oahu, Hawaii, as a suitable location for a new business venture. As the proposed business would be a combination surfing and ice cream shop, weather conditions would likely have significant bearing on the opportunities for success. A statistical analysis was performed, assessing typical weather conditions at different times of the year and drawing on the varying conditions reported by different weather stations.

## Results
* The average temperature in June was 75, while in December it was 71. Little fluctuation in warm average temperatures yearround suggests that Oahu is a strong candidate for locating a combination surfing and ice cream shop.
* Maximum temperatures of 85 in June and 83 in December are also fairly consistent yearround. The relative lack of extreme heat conditions suggests an ease in planning that would ensure an adequate supply of ice cream could be kept on hand, due to the relative lack of spikes in demand due to extreme heat.
* The minimum temperatures of 64 in June and 56 in December show more variation that other measurements, but nothing that would strong indicate against continues demand for both surfing and ice cream.

## Summary
This analysis suggests that overall, Oahu would be an excellent location for opening a combination surfing and icecream shop. Because of the general consistency of the weather, the next step would be to take advantage of more fine-grained data to see if there are any advantages to be gained by locating the business on one part of the island versus any other. Comparing the data from individual weather stations could suggest a way to find a slight advantage in aiming toward ideal weather conditions. Additional queries might focus on something crucial to a surf shop, which is wave conditions. This is worth examining to look for consistent patterns in wave conditions most conducive to surfing. Less frequent, but relevant, events like major storms could also affect how many surfers are drawn to the area.
